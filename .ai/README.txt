# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Adobe Creative Cloud

This integration layer enables interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Adobe Creative Cloud applications, providing a unified interface for automation, content analysis, and AI-assisted workflows.

## Architecture Overview

The MCP integration layer for Adobe Creative Cloud is designed to address the heterogeneous API ecosystem across different Adobe applications. It provides a unified interface for interacting with applications like Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Adobe Aero.

### Key Components

1. **Core Layer**
   - Type definitions and interfaces
   - API client with retry mechanisms
   - Model Context Protocol implementation

2. **Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.0 with PKCE implementation
   - Secure token management
   - Cross-platform secure storage

3. **Application Adapters**
   - Lightroom REST API adapter
   - ExtendScript automation for Premiere Pro and After Effects
   - Exploratory interfaces for Aero

4. **Communication Layer**
   - WebSocket-based bidirectional communication
   - HTTP polling fallback
   - In-memory testing channel

5. **Utilities**
   - Secure storage implementations
   - Cryptographic utilities
   - Logging infrastructure

## Technical Workflow

### Authentication Flow

1. **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE**
   - Generate code verifier and challenge
   - Redirect user to Adobe authorization endpoint
   - Exchange authorization code for tokens
   - Securely store tokens
   - Auto-refresh mechanism for expired tokens

### API Communication

1. **Typed API Clients**
   - Type-safe request and response handling
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Error boundary management
   - Idempotent operations

2. **Application-Specific Adapters**
   - Handle differences in API maturity across applications
   - Convert between application-specific data structures and MCP interfaces
   - Implement workarounds for limited APIs

### Bidirectional Communication

1. **Server-Side Components**
   - Real-time WebSocket communication
   - Message queue for offline operation
   - Reconnection strategies
   - Message deduplication

2. **Client-Side Integration**
   - Event-based architecture
   - Context propagation
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## API Maturity Considerations

Adobe Creative Cloud applications have varying levels of API maturity:

1. **Lightroom**
   - Well-documented RESTful API
   - Comprehensive asset management capabilities
   - Strong authentication and access control

2. **Photoshop**
   - Mix of REST APIs and ExtendScript
   - Growing UXP plugin ecosystem
   - Some functionality only available through desktop scripting

3. **Premiere Pro / After Effects**
   - Primarily ExtendScript-based automation
   - Limited direct API access
   - Requires CEP panel integration for advanced features

4. **Aero**
   - Emerging APIs
   - Limited documentation
   - Experimental integration points

## Integration Strategies for Limited APIs

For applications with limited or non-existent public APIs, the following strategies are employed:

1. **ExtendScript Bridges**
   - JavaScript-based automation via Adobe's ExtendScript engine
   - Communication through local ports or file system
   - CEP panel integration for UI interaction

2. **UXP Plugin System**
   - Leverage Adobe's Unified Extensibility Platform where available
   - Create custom plugins that expose functionality
   - Bridge between UXP and external services

3. **Reverse-Engineered APIs**
   - Analyze existing plugins and applications
   - Document unofficial endpoints and mechanisms
   - Use with caution due to potential future changes

4. **Desktop Integration**
   - File system monitoring for interchange
   - Local server for communication
   - Clipboard integration as fallback

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to accommodate evolution in Adobe's ecosystem:

1. **Adapter Pattern**
   - New applications can be integrated by implementing adapters
   - Core functionality remains stable while adapters evolve

2. **Capability Detection**
   - Runtime detection of available APIs and features
   - Graceful degradation when features are unavailable

3. **Version Management**
   - Support for multiple API versions simultaneously
   - Migration strategies for breaking changes

4. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Custom plugins can extend the core functionality
   - Third-party developers can contribute adapters
