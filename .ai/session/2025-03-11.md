## Goal
Fix build issues in the SnipShot application and ensure it runs properly.

## Context
The SnipShot application is a macOS app for creating beautiful image mockups and code snippets. The application had several build issues that needed to be fixed, particularly around the export functionality and image handling.

- Sources/SnipShot/Views/CodeSnippetView.swift
- Makefile
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md

## Requirements
- Fix all build errors in the codebase
- Ensure the application runs correctly
- Update documentation to reflect changes

## Progress
- [x] Fixed ImagePicker implementation in ImageMockupView.swift
- [x] Fixed AttributedString extension in ExportManager.swift
- [x] Implemented CodeHighlighter class in CodeSnippetView.swift
- [x] Fixed PDF export logic in ExportManager.swift
- [x] Updated Makefile to use the correct path for the `make run` command
- [x] Successfully built and ran the application
- [x] Updated README to include Makefile commands
- [x] Created CHANGELOG.md to document fixed issues
- [x] Updated project status in .ai/status/2025-03-11.md

## Notes
- The main issues were related to threading models in SwiftUI with @MainActor requirements
- Image handling required proper UTType references
- PDF export needed correct CGContext creation
- The Makefile needed updating to properly locate the built application
