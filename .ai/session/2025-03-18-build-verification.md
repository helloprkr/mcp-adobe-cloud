## Session Overview
This session focused on verifying the build process and HIPAA-compliant launch mechanisms for the SnipShot application. We successfully tested the full build pipeline from source code to execution, with particular attention to the accessibility features for users with physical limitations in HIPAA-regulated environments.

## Completed Tasks

### Build Verification
- [x] Executed `make setup` to generate Xcode project and download required assets
- [x] Successfully built the application with `make build`
- [x] Executed the application via `make run`
- [x] Confirmed proper handling of security restrictions
- [x] Verified application copying to Desktop for easier access
- [x] Confirmed proper permission settings for execution without Terminal
- [x] Validated LaunchServices registration process

### HIPAA-Compliance Testing
- [x] Verified the launch-with-permissions.sh script functions as designed
- [x] Confirmed security workarounds for Gatekeeper restrictions
- [x] Tested quarantine attribute removal
- [x] Validated proper file permissions for accessibility
- [x] Confirmed LaunchServices registration for direct launching

### Documentation Enhancement
- [x] Added detailed build confirmation to status updates
- [x] Documented the successful execution flow
- [x] Updated session information with build verification results
- [x] Confirmed HIPAA-compliant launch instructions are accurate

## Technical Details

### Build Command Output
```
ðŸ”¨ Building SnipShot...
// Command line invocation and build process output
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

### Launch Process
The launch process follows these steps:
1. Build application via Xcode build system
2. Copy built app to Desktop for easy access
3. Set executable permissions on all required binaries
4. Remove quarantine attributes that would trigger security dialogs
5. Register application with LaunchServices
6. Launch application via `open` command

### Security Considerations
As expected, the security assessment fails due to lack of code signing:
```
Checking security assessment...
/Users/maximvs/Desktop/SnipShot.app: rejected
```

However, the launch script successfully bypasses this restriction via:
1. Manual removal of quarantine attributes
2. Proper permission settings
3. Direct invocation via `open` command

## Next Steps
1. Complete integration of HIPAA-compliant logging during application usage
2. Implement auto-save feature for users who cannot trigger manual saves
3. Enhance voice command integration for hands-free operation
4. Add proper code signing for production release
5. Begin testing with assistive technologies

## Blockers and Issues
- Security assessment failure requires manual workarounds
- Lack of code signing prevents simple double-click launching without our custom scripts
- Voice command integration needs further development
