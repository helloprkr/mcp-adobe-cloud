- Creating Model Context Protocol (MCP) blueprints for better AI integration
- Updating documentation in `.ai/README.md`
- Creating MCP integration rules
- Conducting comprehensive codebase review
- Implementing proper Git repository management

## Next Steps
From the previous session, the following tasks were identified:

1. Setup CI/CD pipeline with Dagger using the new MCP rules
2. Add monitoring and logging system
3. Create MCP rule implementation examples for real-world scenarios
4. Develop testing framework to validate code against MCP rules
5. Explore enhancement of ToyProgrammer's AI code generation capabilities
6. Improve containerization practices following Docker MCP rules

Today's session will focus on progressing these items, starting with the CI/CD pipeline setup using the new MCP rules.
