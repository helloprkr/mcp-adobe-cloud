# Project Status: SnipShot - 2024-03-11

## Overview

SnipShot is a macOS application for creating beautiful image mockups and code snippets. It combines features similar to Shots.so and Snappify into a native macOS app built with SwiftUI.

## Recent Progress

- ✅ Initial project structure created with XcodeGen configuration
- ✅ Core application architecture implemented with SwiftUI
- ✅ Image mockup views with device frame support
- ✅ Code snippet views with syntax highlighting using HighlightSwift
- ✅ Export functionality for PNG, JPG, and PDF formats
- ✅ Project save/load capability
- ✅ Automated setup script created for easy onboarding
- ✅ Updated README with comprehensive usage instructions

## Current State

- The application has a complete codebase ready for building and testing
- Core features are fully implemented
- Setup automation is in place to simplify onboarding
- Documentation has been improved for better usability

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] User testing to gather feedback on UX
- [ ] Potential additional device frames beyond iPhone and MacBook
- [ ] Explore additional code language support
- [ ] Consider cloud sharing or export to social media
- [ ] Performance optimization for large images or complex code snippets

## Architecture Notes

The application follows a clean architecture with:

1. **Views Layer**: `/Sources/SnipShot/Views/`
   - ImageMockupView - For creating device mockups
   - CodeSnippetView - For styling code snippets
   - ContentView - Main navigation and layout

2. **Models Layer**: `/Sources/SnipShot/Models/`
   - ProjectModel - Core data model with persistence logic

3. **Managers Layer**: `/Sources/SnipShot/Managers/`
   - ExportManager - Handles exporting in various formats

## Setup Instructions

The project now includes an automated setup script that:

1. Installs necessary dependencies (Homebrew, XcodeGen)
2. Generates the Xcode project configuration
3. Opens the project in Xcode for building

To use it:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

Users can also work with VS Code using the provided tasks.

## Technical Decisions

1. **SwiftUI**: Chosen for modern UI development and responsive design
2. **XcodeGen**: Used for project generation to avoid Xcode configuration issues
3. **HighlightSwift**: Integrated for syntax highlighting in code snippets
4. **Project file format**: JSON format for project data to enable easy versioning

## Next Steps

1. Build and test the initial version
2. Gather user feedback on the UI and feature set
3. Consider additional device frames and code languages
4. Explore performance optimizations for complex renderings
