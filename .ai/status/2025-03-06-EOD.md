- **Session Duration**: 4 hours 30 minutes

## Development Steps

1. Created Model Context Protocol (MCP) blueprints for better AI integration
   - Developed `mcp-overview.md` explaining the core MCP concepts and structure
   - Created `cursor-mcp-rules.md` for optimizing Cursor editor with Go, Dagger, and Docker
   - Implemented `go-mcp-rules.md` for Go language patterns and best practices
   - Added `dagger-mcp-rules.md` for Dagger CI/CD and container workflows
   - Developed `docker-mcp-rules.md` for Docker containerization best practices

2. Updated `.ai/README.md` documentation
   - Added new MCP Blueprints section with links to all MCP rule files
   - Organized MCP blueprints as a subsection under existing Blueprints

3. Created MCP integration rule
   - Implemented `.ai/rules/mcp-integration.md` to define AI behavior with MCP
   - Added specific rules for Go, Dagger, and Docker development
   - Defined problem-solving approach based on MCP principles

4. Conducted comprehensive codebase review
   - Analyzed project structure and dependencies
   - Examined ToyProgrammer and ToyWorkspace modules
   - Reviewed Dagger integration patterns and container workflows
   - Identified key architectural components and their relationships

5. Implemented proper Git repository management
   - Resolved nested git repository issue with .ai directory
   - Set up .ai as a proper git submodule
   - Committed and pushed all changes to the fork repository
   - Maintained separation between original repository and fork

## Key Decisions

- Structured MCP rules in JSON format for better machine readability
- Used consistent pattern format across all technology contexts
- Included detailed code examples to illustrate proper usage patterns
- Organized blueprints hierarchically with an overview document
- Implemented integration with existing AI development tools
- Focused on Go-specific patterns that align with idiomatic Go principles
- Adopted proper Git submodule architecture for .ai tooling integration
- Maintained clear separation between fork and original repository

## Next Steps

1. Setup CI/CD pipeline with Dagger using the new MCP rules
2. Add monitoring and logging system
3. Create MCP rule implementation examples for real-world scenarios
4. Develop testing framework to validate code against MCP rules
5. Explore enhancement of ToyProgrammer's AI code generation capabilities
6. Improve containerization practices following Docker MCP rules

Progress: Completed comprehensive MCP rule implementation for Go, Dagger, and Docker development. Successfully reviewed codebase architecture and implemented proper Git repository management with submodules. Next session will focus on implementing quantum state management as outlined in the previous session while applying the newly created MCP rules.
