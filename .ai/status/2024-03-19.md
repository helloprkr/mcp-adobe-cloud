# Session Update: 2024-03-19

## Development Steps
1. Implemented DimensionalTranscender class
   - Created core transcension logic
   - Added dimension management functionality
   - Integrated with MetamorphicProcessor

2. Added comprehensive test suite
   - Unit tests for dimension creation
   - Tests for multi-dimensional state management
   - Integration tests with MetamorphicProcessor

## Key Decisions
- Used singleton pattern for DimensionalTranscender
- Implemented Map for efficient dimension storage
- Added metadata tracking for each dimension
- Maintained type safety through generics

## Next Steps
1. Setup CI/CD pipeline
2. Add monitoring and logging system

Progress: Completed DimensionalTranscender implementation with tests. Next session will focus on CI/CD pipeline setup and monitoring system implementation.
