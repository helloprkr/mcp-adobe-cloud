# SnipShot Status Update

## Date: 2025-03-11

## Current Status
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Application launches correctly from desktop (with security workarounds)
- ✅ Fixed launch script to properly handle macOS security protections
- ✅ Implemented proper file permissions and launch service registration

## Recent Progress
- Fixed the SnipShotApp.swift file to directly show the ContentView instead of using a welcome screen
- Added missing resetProject and saveProjectAs methods to ProjectModel
- Enhanced launch.sh to handle macOS security features:
  - Removed quarantine attributes
  - Set proper permissions for app bundle files
  - Added LaunchServices registration
  - Implemented Gatekeeper workarounds
- Built the app with explicit code signing options for better security compatibility

## Identified Issues
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks the app when double-clicked due to lack of code signing
- Security & Privacy panel may need to be used for "Allow Anyway" on first launch
- App resources signature validation fails, but doesn't prevent functionality

## Pending Tasks
- Implement proper code signing for production release
- Add notarization process for distribution
- Ensure all features work correctly (image mockups, code snippets, export)
- Add more robust error handling
- Improve user experience
- Add more documentation

## Architecture
- SwiftUI-based macOS application
- Uses ProjectModel as the main data model
- ContentView as the main interface with tabs for ImageMockupView and CodeSnippetView
- ExportManager for exporting projects in different formats

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make setup` to set up the project
3. Run `make build` to build the application
4. Run `make run` to launch the application

## Technical Decisions
- Simplified the app structure by removing the welcome screen and AppDelegate
- Using direct ContentView loading for better reliability
- Enhanced launch script to handle macOS security features
- Added specific permission settings and launch service registration
- Used explicit code signing options for development builds

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper code signing for production
2. Test all features thoroughly
3. Add more robust error handling
4. Improve user experience
5. Add more documentation
