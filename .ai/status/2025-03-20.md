## Current Project State
Based on the codebase review, the RemoteCode project is focused on:

1. **RemoteCode Application**: Creating a comprehensive system that enables remote coding from iPhone to Mac Mini
   - macOS app (RemoteCodeMacApp) with environment, connection, and LLM managers
   - Secure SSH configuration and authentication (SecureKeyManager)
   - Local LLM integration for coding assistance (LocalLLMManager)
   - Container management for development environments (ContainerManager)
   - Multi-provider LLM integration (LLMManager with local and API options)

2. **AI Framework Implementation**: Utilizing the `.ai` framework for:
   - Maintaining project context across sessions
   - Documenting learnings and errors in the Codex
   - Following structured development guidelines
   - Implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI interactions

## Next Steps

1. **RemoteCode Implementation**:
   - Enhance SSH key management for secure connections between devices
   - Implement robust error handling for network connectivity issues
   - Optimize local LLM models for mobile-friendly resource usage
   - Create a unified interface for container management on macOS
   - Improve UI/UX for mobile coding experience

2. **AI Framework Enhancement**:
   - Continue developing MCP blueprints for better AI integration
   - Implement testing framework to validate code against MCP rules
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with Dagger using the MCP rules
   - Document the multi-layered architecture approach in the Codex

## Development Guidelines

1. Maintain the manager-based architecture pattern for separation of concerns
2. Prioritize security in all cross-device communications
3. Optimize for low-latency, reliable connections in mobile environments
4. Implement graceful degradation when network conditions are suboptimal
5. Follow Swift best practices for all application code

Today's session will focus on enhancing the security model for SSH connections and improving the local LLM integration for coding assistance.
