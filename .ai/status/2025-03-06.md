# Session Update: 2025-03-06

## Development Steps

1. Created `README.md` in the root directory
   - Added comprehensive documentation about the Toy Programmer application
   - Included installation instructions, usage examples, and project structure
   - Linked to the AI development tools documentation

2. Reviewed the codebase structure
   - Analyzed the ToyProgrammer and ToyWorkspace modules
   - Understood the containerized environment setup
   - Explored the AI integration with Dagger

## Key Decisions

- Structured README.md with clear sections for better readability
- Focused on explaining both the high-level concept and technical implementation
- Added code examples to demonstrate usage patterns

## Next Steps

1. Setup CI/CD pipeline
2. Add monitoring and logging system
3. Expand ToyProgrammer with additional language support
4. Improve documentation with more detailed examples

Progress: Completed basic documentation setup. Next session will focus on implementing quantum state management as outlined in the previous session.
